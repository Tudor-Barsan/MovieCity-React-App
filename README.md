# ðŸŽ¥ Movie City

Learned React by creating a movie browsing app where users can search for and find information on a variety of different movies

## ðŸ§  Building this project taught me how to:
* Create and organize a React app
* Define and use React components and props
* Use React's "useState" and "useEffect" hooks
* Connect and fetch data from an API (OMBD API)
